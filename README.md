# fake-review-detection
This code mainly refers to github.com/YingtongDou/Nash-Detect.
If there is any problem, email me(seyeon717@yonsei.ac.kr).
Feel free to give me any comments or suggestions about this project.
I modified the initial settings of YingtongDou to three players(promotion spammer, demotion spammer and detector).
